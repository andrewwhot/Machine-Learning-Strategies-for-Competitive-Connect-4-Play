# Machine-Learning-Strategies-for-Competitive-Connect-4-Play
A multi-headed project with the aim of teaching two machine learning models (a convolutional neural network and a transformer model) how to make optimal decisions in games of Connect 4, based off of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated board states and games.
